    # In the statements coded below, ensure that any statement that could result 
    # in an exception is handled.  When exceptions are 'caught', display the exception 
    # message to the console.

    # 1. Code a statement which creates a valid instance of the Client class.
    # Use your own unique valid values for the inputs to the class.




    # 2. Declare a BankAccount object with an initial value of None.

 

    # 3. Using the bank_account object declared in step 2, code a statement 
    # to instantiate the BankAccount object.
    # Use any integer value for the BankAccount number.
    # Use the client_number used to create the Client object in step 1 for the 
    # BankAccount's client_number. 
    # Use a floating point value for the balance. 
    



    # 4. Code a statement which creates an instance of the BankAccount class.
    # Use any integer value for the BankAccount number.
    # Use the client_number used to create the Client object in step 1 for the 
    # BankAccount's client_number. 
    # Use an INVALID value (non-float) for the balance. 



    # 5. Code a statement which prints the Client instance created in step 1. 
    # Code a statement which prints the BankAccount instance created in step 3.




    # 6. Attempt to deposit a non-numeric value into the BankAccount create in step 3. 



    # 7. Attempt to deposit a negative value into the BankAccount create in step 3. 



    # 8. Attempt to withdraw a valid amount of your choice from the BankAccount create in step 3. 



    # 9. Attempt to withdraw a non-numeric value from the BankAccount create in step 3. 



    # 10. Attempt to withdraw a negative value from the BankAccount create in step 3. 



    # 11. Attempt to withdraw a value from the BankAccount create in step 3 which 
    # exceeds the current balance of the account. 
 
 

    # 12. Code a statement which prints the BankAccount instance created in step 3.
